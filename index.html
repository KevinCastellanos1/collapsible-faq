                <h3>What technical and soft skills do you consider essential for software development and the technology industry in general?</h3>
                <p>In software development and the technology industry in general, it is important to keep in mind that not all companies require the same technical knowledge. Therefore, it is important to have a solid foundation in a programming language and understand its logic and operation for greater adaptability to a company's requirements or to create a specific project. In addition, it is fundamental to have soft skills such as organization, adaptability, teamwork, and effective communication to complement and enhance technical skills, achieving optimal performance in software development.</p>
                <p>These skills are considered necessary due to the fact that the technology industry is constantly evolving and changing, with a wide variety of programming languages and technologies, and therefore it is essential to have a solid foundation and an integrated approach to software development.</p>
